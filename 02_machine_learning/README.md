# Machine Learning

## Overview
Foundational machine learning concepts, algorithms, and techniques that form the basis for deep learning and specialized AI applications.

## Learning Path
Based on the [AI Learning Path visualization](../ai_mind_map/ai_complete_learning_path.html).

## Prerequisites
