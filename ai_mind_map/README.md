## 🎯 Quick Start

### For Learners:

**On GitHub:**
1. **View the mindmap**: Open [AI_LEARNING_MINDMAP_MERMAID.md](AI_LEARNING_MINDMAP_MERMAID.md) - it renders automatically!
2. **Choose your path**: Read [LEARNING_PATHS.md](LEARNING_PATHS.md)
3. **Start learning**: Navigate to the appropriate module in the parent directory

**For Local/Detailed Exploration:**
1. Download and open [ai_learning_mindmap.html](ai_learning_mindmap.html) in your browser for the full interactive experience
2. Use the reference docs as needed

### For Instructors:
1. **Review structure**: Check [PROPOSED_REORGANIZATION.md](PROPOSED_REORGANIZATION.md)
2. **See implementation plan**: Read [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
3. **Decide on changes**: Choose which proposals to implement
