# Data Engineering

## Overview
Techniques and tools for collecting, preprocessing, storing, and building pipelines for machine learning data.

## Learning Path
Based on the [AI Learning Path visualization](../ai_mind_map/ai_complete_learning_path.html).

## Prerequisites
- Python programming
- Understanding of data formats and structures
- Basic command line skills

## Key Topics

### ✅ Completed
- **Data Collection** - Downloading and gathering datasets
- **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning, transformation, feature extraction

### 📋 Planned
- **Data Pipelines** - Automated ETL workflows
- **Data Storage** - Databases, data lakes, efficient storage formats

## Contents
- `data_collection/` - Scripts for data acquisition ✅
- `data_preprocessing/` - Data cleaning and transformation ✅
  - Format conversion scripts
  - Data preparation utilities
  - Feature engineering tools
- `data_pipelines/` - Automated data workflows 📋
- `data_storage/` - Storage solutions and optimization 📋

## Current Status
- ✅ **Active Work:** Data preprocessing scripts for voice cloning project
- Scripts handle audio format conversion, feature extraction, and dataset preparation
- Large datasets (~1.6GB) stored locally but gitignored

## Tools Used
- Python for scripting
- Shell scripts for batch processing
- Audio processing libraries
