## 📌 Summary

### Three Pillars of This Learning Path:

1. **Theory** - Comprehensive guides in each module's LEARNING_GUIDE.md
2. **Practice** - Hands-on Python scripts and exercises
3. **Projects** - Real-world applications culminating in the capstone

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional but recommended)
- Basic command-line knowledge

### Quick Start
1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-cloning-pipeline.git
   cd voice-cloning-pipeline
   ```

2. **Start with environment setup**
   ```bash
   cd 00_env_setup
   # Follow instructions in README.md
   ```

3. **Begin learning path**
   ```bash
   cd ../02_deep_learning_basics
   python 01_hello_pytorch.py
   ```

### Data Setup

**Note:** The `data/` folders are excluded from git via `.gitignore` to keep the repository lightweight. You must manually download or generate required datasets.

#### Downloading LibriTTS Sample Data (for TTS training)

1. Visit [LibriTTS on OpenSLR](https://www.openslr.org/60/) or [LibriTTS on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lj1995/LibriTTS)
2. Download desired subset (e.g., `dev-clean`)
3. Extract to `07_data_preparation/data/libritts_sample/LibriTTS/`
4. Your structure should look like:
   ```
   07_data_preparation/
   └── data/
       └── libritts_sample/
           └── LibriTTS/
               └── dev-clean/
   ```

**Important:** Do not add large datasets or audio files to git!

## 📖 Capstone Project: Custom Voice Replication Pipeline

**Goal:** Build an end-to-end pipeline that processes text and generates speech in your own voice.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Collection** - Record voice samples (10 short + 10 long)
2. **Preprocessing** - Trim, normalize, convert to WAV 24kHz mono
3. **Feature Extraction** - Extract MFCCs and spectrograms with librosa
4. **Model Training** - Train TTS model (Tacotron/FastSpeech/Coqui TTS)
5. **Text Processing** - Use NLP to clean and segment input
6. **Inference** - Generate speech from new text
7. **Deployment** - Build REST API (Flask/FastAPI)
8. **Evaluation** - Test quality and iterate

**Outcome:** A modular, working system that can read any text in your own voice, with all core AI skills practiced through manageable tasks.
