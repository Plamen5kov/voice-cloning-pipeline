# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview
Techniques and models for processing, understanding, and generating human language, including speech and audio processing.

## Learning Path
Based on the [AI Learning Path visualization](../ai_mind_map/ai_complete_learning_path.html).

## Prerequisites
- Deep Learning fundamentals (RNNs, Transformers)
- Machine Learning basics
- Python programming

## Key Topics

### ✅ Completed
- **Speech & Audio** - Text-to-speech systems, voice cloning, audio processing

### 📋 Planned
- **Text Processing** - Tokenization, normalization, preprocessing
- **Word Embeddings** - Word2Vec, GloVe, contextual embeddings
- **Language Models** - LLMs, GPT architectures, fine-tuning
- **Question Answering** - Information retrieval, QA systems
- **Translation** - Machine translation, sequence-to-sequence models
