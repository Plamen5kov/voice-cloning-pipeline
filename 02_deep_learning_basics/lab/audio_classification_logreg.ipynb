    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "- Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.\n",
    "- Use `np.dot(X,Y)` to calculate dot products.\n",

    "**What to remember from this assignment:**\n",
    "1. Preprocessing the dataset is important (converting audio to spectrograms).\n",
    "2. You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().\n",
    "3. Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a \"hyperparameter\") can make a big difference to the algorithm.\n",
    "4. Audio classification follows the same principles as image classification when using appropriate representations (spectrograms).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to try:**\n",
    "- Play with the learning rate and the number of iterations\n",
    "- Try different audio datasets (voice vs non-voice, male vs female, etc.)\n",
    "- Experiment with different spectrogram parameters (n_mels, duration)\n",
    "- Collect your own audio samples and train on them!"
