    "Now you will implement the backward function for the whole network! Recall that when you implemented the `L_model_forward` function, at each iteration, you stored a cache which contains (X,W,b, and z). In the backpropagation module, you'll use those variables to compute the gradients. Therefore, in the `L_model_backward` function, you'll iterate through all the hidden layers backward, starting from layer $L$. On each step, you will use the cached values for layer $l$ to backpropagate through layer $l$. Figure 5 below shows the backward pass. \n",
