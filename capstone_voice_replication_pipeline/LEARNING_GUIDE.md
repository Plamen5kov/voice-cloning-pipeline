# Capstone: Voice Replication Pipeline - Learning Guide

## 🎯 Capstone Project Overview

Build a complete, production-ready voice cloning system that can generate audiobooks in your own voice. This project integrates everything you've learned across all modules.

## 📚 Final Deliverable

A fully functional voice cloning pipeline that:
- Accepts any text input
- Processes and cleans the text
- Generates speech in your voice
- Produces high-quality audio output
- Can be deployed as a web service

## 🎓 Capstone Objectives

By completing this capstone, you will:
- [ ] Have a working voice cloning system
- [ ] Demonstrate mastery of all 12 modules
- [ ] Build a portfolio-worthy project

**Success Criteria**: Pipeline processes text to audio in <30 seconds

---

### Phase 5: Deployment (Week 6)
**Goal**: Deploy as accessible web service

Tasks:
- [ ] Build FastAPI REST API
- [ ] Add web interface (optional)
- [ ] Containerize with Docker
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (AWS/GCP)
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Document API usage

**Success Criteria**: Service accessible online, responds to requests

---

### Phase 6: Documentation & Presentation (Week 7)
**Goal**: Document project and prepare demo

Tasks:
- [ ] Write comprehensive README
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
